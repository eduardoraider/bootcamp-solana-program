Web3 Engineer - Solana Program
-----
This project is for devs that want to get into Solana which is now one of the biggest blockchains in the world.
You'll learn some Rust, write and implement a Solana program, and plug it all into a React web3 application that anyone with a Solana wallet can interact with!
